# Cursor Rules

These rules are designed for the [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.com/) following their [documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules)

## Testing prompts

Prompts we use to test the rules to see how they perform.

```
Build a Temporal application using the Python SDK that allows the user to submit text and the application posts that text to their X, Bluesky, and Mastodon account. 
```

**We're still learning as well. PRs and new rules very welcome!**
